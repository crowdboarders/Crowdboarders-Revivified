		<h1>Faqs</h1><br>
       <p>1. Why is CrowdBoarders so different from the traditional Crowdfunding Platforms?</p><br>

CrowdBoarders is the world first social investing network which was purposely designed and built to create a new Crowdfunding Eco-System, this offers everyone the chance to join, participate, learn, create, invest and connect with likeminded people worldwide using over 50 new social features designed specifically for pure enjoyment and most importantly to provide the chance for anyone to make a difference in this world by using the best place possible to showcase their creative ideas and raise the necessary online funds to make them swiftly become a reality<br><br>

<p>2. Who is a CrowdBoarder and how do I become one? </p><br>
 Everyone is a CrowdBoarder, all you have to do is create a login, then you are ready to go, once inside CrowdBoarders you are free to enjoy all the social interaction you want and invest in as many exciting opportunities as you like found on all of our CrowdBoards that people create.<br><br>

<p>3. I am really interested in CrowdFunding but every traditional site I go to just asks me if I have a project to start or do I want to invest in one? I have created some profiles but they are really basic and have very limited networking making it really difficult for me to connect to other people, then also after I join I constantly get lots of emails asking me if I am ready to start now but in truth I am not, as I currently do not have an idea for a project and also really want to learn a lot more about this before I start really investing, how can you at CrowdBoarders help me with my current dilemma? </p><br>

Of course we can, the best part of CrowdBoarders is that it was primarily built to be a Social Network, so we actively encourage everyone firstly to just come and join in! You can firstly build your own in-depth profile showing all the great things about you and what you want to achieve. Then actively search the Network for other CrowdBoarders you would like to connect with or people you already know, send out connection invites and even for some to add them to your very own Boarders Lineup, which displays your top connections on your profile and can be used for the people you most want to associate with in CrowdFunding. You also have your very own Console which displays all the latest information, what new Boards have been created, latest news from all the other CrowdBoarders, we even have a message feature so you can contact anyone directly at any time. We do not add you to email lists or send you constant requests to start projects, we want you to enjoy the social fun, get to know people, you may later even decide to team up with someone with a similar idea or even invest yourself in something that you feel passionate about, it is entirely up to you how and when you participate, we just want you to be a part of it now!<br><br>

<p>4. What is a CrowdBoard is that something new or different that you have created?</p> 
<br>Yes, we thought it would be pretty cool to give the Industry its own specific term for raising money online, rather than Projects, Campaigns, Raises, Pitches which can all have lots of different meanings, so we came up with a CrowdBoard, on which you can now display your creative idea for anything to actively seek mass participation and then make it happen.<br><br>

<p>5. How do I create a CrowdBoard for my idea and how can it be easily found by all the other CrowdBoarders in the Network to increase my chances of success? </p><br>

Firstly anyone can create a CrowdBoard in only 4 easy steps, actually in one of these steps you personally get to choose the ideal District you want to display it in. We also really believe people's creative ideas should not be put into limited categories, hidden away in difficult to find places like everyone else; instead we thought it would be really neat if these great creative ideas were prominently displayed in specific Districts such as Gaming, Design and Films. We currently have 20 Districts to choose from and within each District a further 10 Areas of specialty to ensure your creative idea gets maximum visibility and an increased chance of success by being really easy to find. Every CrowdBoarder has their own Console which they can save their favorite Districts on and with its unique design they can then quickly locate any new CrowdBoards of interest to them from within their own Network, rather than scrolling through pages and pages as casual visitors like the traditional sites with their low success rates.<br><br>

<p>6. What are the fees to join CrowdBoarders and how much will you charge me if I create a CrowdBoard and then raise funds for my idea?
</p><br>
CrowdBoarders is FREE to join, and if you create your own CrowdBoard we charge you ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to raise your funds, we fully believe that there should be no charge whatsoever for creativity, you are looking to make a difference in the World and the CrowdBoarders that believe and invest in your idea will happily pay small fees , the same way that we all buy concert tickets today, the performers do not pay anything and the participants traditionally pay some type of service fees when purchasing a ticket to be a part of that unique experience.
<br><br>

<p>7. How much money can I raise on a CrowdBoard and how will the funding process work in terms of setup, duration, overfunding and receiving funds? </p><br>
You can create a CrowdBoard dependent on the type of Board for any amount between the minimum of $100 up to the Equity maximum of $1m or without limits for any of the other types. When you create your CrowdBoard you specify the amount required, set the different levels of investments and associated rewards involved in one of the 4 easy steps. Traditional platforms have set durations and encourage overfunding to increase their fees which often leads to slow participation and low success rates, at CrowdBoarders we firmly believe that the Boards success is the most important thing so we donâ€™t set durations instead we promote it as long as possible, and close the Board as soon as it reaches its target funds level after all that is the true purpose, this encourages CrowdBoarders to invest quickly and increases the chances of success, like concert tickets when they are all gone it is too late. If your board is wildly successful and quickly sells out you can even create a Second Wave CrowdBoard after to capture more funds for your great idea if needed. CrowdBoarders is also Industry CAPS Accredited to ensure security of information and payments so we utilize Balanced as our preferred 3rd Party transaction partner, you simply set up an account with them when you create your CrowdBoard so that you can receive your funds directly from Balanced once your CrowdBoard has reached its financial target.
<br><br>
<p>8. How do I track the progress of my CrowdBoard and provide any updates to my fellow CrowdBoarders that have invested in my idea and provide them their rewards when ready? </p><br>
At CrowdBoarders you have a unique function which you can access via your Console called CrowdBoard Command this allows you to quickly view the live status and performance of your Board , it also has a feature Insider News where you can make posts anytime for all of your investors to see with all your latest news, also they canwatch it, add comments or ratings so you can always see what they are thinking of your idea, it also displays all of their Insider Details so you can make sure that they can receive the right rewards for their investment when the right time comes.<br><br>

<p>9. How can I best create and promote my CrowdBoard to the public to solicit their investment and also assist me so that I can reach my funds goal as I hear in the region of 60% of all CrowdFunding campaigns in the Industry are currently unsuccessful? </p>
<br>
After you have created your CrowdBoard in 4 easy steps, you have the option to save the draft, send it live or add extras; this is where you can add links, videos and anything you want to make your Board look better and ideally more likely to succeed. As CrowdBoarders is a Live Network of people like you there will already be lots of interest in your District for ideas like yours. Also other CrowdBoarders can help you by recommending and boosting your Board within CrowdBoarders so everyone can see that in our latest Crowd News feature. The more CrowdBoarders you get involved the higher the chance of success. You can also always share your idea in other social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, which is the only option you have on traditional platforms and the main reason why so many of their current campaigns are so unsuccessful.<br><br>

<p>10. I am fairly new to CrowdFunding so how can I find help to turn my idea into a CrowdBoard and what if the CrowdBoard I then create does not meet the financial target I initially set?</p><br>

As CrowdBoarders are a People Driven company and not a Process Driven one. We do not send you to online guides or schools; instead you can contact us directly anytime and at any stage of turning your idea in a CrowdBoard. One of our own Consultants that specialize in your particular District would be more than happy to make personal contact and talk with you or by email if you prefer and provide you all the advice you need, free of charge naturally. As we also constantly monitor all CrowdBoards so if it does looks likely that your CrowdBoard might not reach the desired target, we can quickly discuss this with you and provide further creative suggestions to help it fund, once any CrowdBoard funds its set target, the owner will then automatically be eligible to receive all of the total funds raised. There are also donation and gift CrowdBoards where the owner receive funds as they are donated. <br><br>

<p>11. I have now found a CrowdBoard I would like to invest in, so how does it work? On traditional platforms I have invested in, I have found that I get charged a transaction fee % and after investing I have little to no contact with the owner after that and also have to track all my investments myself how is this going to be different with CrowdBoarders?</p><br>
Investing in a CrowdBoard is as simple as viewing the CrowdBoard and clicking the invest button on it, once you have created your Balanced account for the first time you can then save it onto your profile for the future. We also have devised a new payment model which is based on services fees, each investment you make there is a set charge of $1 per transaction and $1 per every $10 you invest. So if you decide to invest $25 your total charge would be $28, similarly if you chose $40 your total charge would be $45. These service fees ensure we can maintain the Social Network for everyone and also cover all the % transaction fees charged by Balanced. Once you have invested in a CrowdBoard it will automatically be placed onto your Boardfolio a new feature that helps you manage and track all of your investments easily. This is accessed directly from your Console and you can choose to keep each one private or make it public whichever you prefer. Within your Boardfolio you can see Boards you are watching and every investment in detail, access the CrowdBoards Insider News for exclusive updates, live performance, latest comments, current ratings and even make your own notes.<br><br>

<p>12. What happens if a CrowdBoard I invest in does not raise its funding target will I receive a refund? Also can I withdraw my investment in a CrowdBoard at any time after I make it if I decide I want to? </p><br>

Naturally if a CrowdBoard fails to fund, your initial investment level will always be fully refunded to you less the service fees that were initially applied, also within your Boardfolio you always have the option to withdraw your funds at any time if you wish until it fully funds, however please bear in mind that as CrowdBoards close when they reach their funding target you may not get the chance again to re-invest into the same Board at a later date if you choose to change your mind onwithdrawing your earlier investment.<br><br>

<p>13. Does CrowdBoarders offer equity CrowdBoards if so how does it work?</p> 
Yes with the recent announcements by the SEC, CrowdBoarders is now able to offer equity opportunities. Businesses offer shares in their company in return for financial investment. When you invest make sure you read the terms and conditions sheet the CrowdBoard owner has on their CrowdBoard, remember you can withdraw your investment any time before the funds have been raised!<br><br>
