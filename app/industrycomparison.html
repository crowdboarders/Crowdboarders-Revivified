        <p> You have probably heard of a few sites online allowing people to raise money, here is what makes CrowdBoarders utterly unique :</p><br><br>
        The only place you can be a CrowdBoarder <br><br>
        Only place you can own a CrowdBoard<br><br>
        Only site in the world  that allows all funding in one place<br> <br>      First ever social investing network<br><br>
        Only site you can raise money for anything for free<br><br>
        Only place you can manage multiples raises at once<br><br>
        Designed the world's first ever console to access the site<br><br>
        Only site to have districts and areas for people to connect and find CrowdBoards they are interested in <br><br>
        First website to have fixed rate variable level funding (meaning crowdboards never over fund)<br><br>
        We invented the Boardfolio (portfolio of the future) <br><br>
        
        <p> It is clear to see we have a lot of innovation but how do we stack up against other online fundraising platforms at their own game? <p><br>
